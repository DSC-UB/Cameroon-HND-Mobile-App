PART A: PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
The product we are going to build is a Cameroon HND android mobile app application aimed at providing HND student with a considerate amount of past questions for their studies and HND exam.
HND is a 2 year university program that student here undergo to have what we call an HND certificate. Most of the field here in Cameroon and many institute offer HND certificate. Though it is a government certificate, an enormous amount of student go in for this program and building an app that could provide them with the best of past questions will be a great dill through their program.

a.	Roles and Responsibilities
	Most of the people that will be working on our project are the HND members, the DSC community members but also our local community (that is who ever want to contribute).  We do this because our HND project is an open source project and we aimed at not only helping the Cameroon HND members but also developers (mostly from our Buea local community) gain the basic skills in open source. 
-	Product owner: Our project is an open source project, so whomever can have access to the source code but the project belongs to the DSC developer clubs.
-	Team member: We have two set of members, main and passive members. Our main members are those who contribute actively to the HND project and belong to our DSC community while our passive members are does who join to contribute to our project through github.com and can only become main members through active interaction and contribution.

-	Stakeholders: Our only stake holders is Google since they sponsor DSC University of Buea and help us have the basic necessities we will need in our projects. The basic necessities we need to develop this project are as follows.
Requirement from stakeholder	Amount	Reason
Internet connection of at least 30GB for period of 3 weeks 	10000FCFA	Most of developers will work remotely since we shall be using github.com as a platform for developing our HND mobile app, so each of them will have their personal internet connection but we shall need internet connection for the meet-ups we have trice per week and most importantly for uploading past question and solutions to the firebase cloud.
Firebase storage of at least 25GB	 	We plan on creating a Google mail and using it free 15GB for our firebase storage to save the document but without doubt, 15GB be sufficient for a wont be sufficient for a first release of the app since each user can add his own past question or solution to cloud.
Guide and Assistance		We shall need guide and assistance from Google since none of us student are expert and are sure to encounter difficulties in the process of development of the application

b.	Team goal and business object
The main aim and goal of the HND team is to provide the user with the best user experience from the HND mobile app that will help them have and take the greatest advantage of the facilities provide to them by the app.
One of our goal is to have complete this app in a period of 3 week starting from today.

c.	Background and Strategy fit
This project was proposed to us the DSC member in the month of November 2019 by the DSC lead. It was said, build a HND app as the context. We went through some study and research to know what we needed to build, for whom what we were building, why should we build what we are building.
We are building this product because it was proposed to us by the DSC lead so that it could be presented for the upcoming DSC community challenge. We found that this project was very beneficial to our community and took the lead of making it see the day.
From our studies which we did by questioning some HND student, HND graduates and through our Google form questionnaire where we received some relevant information, we noticed that, what HND student need the most are past questions, and that the process for payment for their exam is a whole complicated story.
So we decided to build an app that help them have access to past questions for each field and later on and an Improvement that will help them pay their HND fie through MTN or ORANGE mobile money. This app will also help create a communication channel connecting HND student from different institutes and university by commenting and/or providing solutions or remarks to questions or solutions provided by us or the end users
From this, our project completely satisfy it goal that is helping it local community and our country Cameroon and hereby also been eligible to go for the DSC community challenge.

d.	Future User Story
Here, we give some of the personal experience of the user or those that when through the HND program (the graduates). We showcase their name and links to the personal experience of this people and how the will like the app to be to best feed their needs.

e.	Acceptance Criteria
From the studies we went through and decisions made from studying our User story and Google form questionnaire, we came to a conclusion that our mobile app will be aimed at providing a mobile platform for HND student to share past questions and answers and interact together regarding those past questions and answers.
Also, we came to understand that the system of payment is a complicated and long process and each methods of payment is independent of each institute or university. So we decided to provide a harmonious and unique system of payment (that is MTN Mobile Money) that all the institutes offering HND program can use. The link to the questionnaire is given below.

f.	User Interaction and Design
We shall be using figma.com to describe our user experience and design prototype to be implemented by our developers during the development of the HND mobile app. Link to figma.com design 

g.	Reporting and Communication Principles
The main communication means between the project team members is WhatsApp. Reason being that everybody is familiar with the software and it is easy to use.

h.	Risks and Opportunities
The principal risk of this project is the potential decrease in demand due to the fluctuating state of mind of the population, for every human being can desire something and the next second feel completely disinterested in it.
We are granted the opportunity to supply a solution that may not exist yet to a problem aged of several years. Hence the market to which it points is the group of just HND students.
1.2.	DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE
Here we include the main architectural decisions made by the project organizers and which are going to be implemented. We shall focus on the challenging once and elaborate them in the following architectural sectors.
a.	Software design
We discussing with some developers and assistant coordinators, I came to a conclusion that we shall be using the MVVM architecture for the development of our HND mobile application. This reason are because 
-	For android development, Google recommend using the MVVM architecture.
-	Also, this architecture is what users prefer and hence a good choice.
-	Most importantly, from the objective and perspective of our HND mobile application, this is what fit best to portray the best architecture and UX for our app.

b.	Architecture and Design Principle
In the development of our android mobile application we shall be using the MVVM (Model View View Model) Architecture. The MVVM is a design and architecture that makes the code more understandable and easy for any other developer. It makes the code maintainable for a long run. Also, it makes the code stable and more easily to update. 
Following the MVVM Architecture, we shall use the following design principle in the development of the mobile application.
-	Separation of concern: All our code shouldn’t be put in our activities and fragments. The fragment and activities should contain the logics that concerns UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) related things only.
-	Derive UI from Model: Model is the component in our architecture responsible for handling data out of the application. We use this principle our application because the model is independent from the view and hence not affected by the activity life cycle problem.

c.	Solution Detail:
-	Activity/Fragment: The activities/fragment provide effective and swift user experience to the users and help them to properly navigate through the UI of the mobile application. This activity and fragment also provide appropriate data view the views for their user use. 
-	View Model (Live Data): The View Model update data from the repository and display it on the activities/fragments. The view model do not update data for an activity that has being or doesn’t exist destroyed. Any attempt to do this causes the app immediately crash and stop functioning. The model view receives the request to load data from the Activities/Fragments and then collect the data in a certain manner (algorithm dependent) and load it on the respective views. The View Model solves the problem of how live data is being handled.
-	Repository: The view model refreshes the data from the repository. It solves the problem of how data is being handle, organized, saved to and fetch from it respective source. The View Model is dependent of the repository. The repository is responsible for uploading the required data and sending it to the view model.
The repository may use the local database or the server (cloud) which might use api’s to upload the data. The repository can get data from many source and hence first of all tries to fetch data from the local storage and if the data is not found locally, it loads the data from the cloud storage.
-	Remote Data Source (Firebase): The remote data source is where our data is originally found and stored. We shall be using firebase storage to store our files and firebase database to store user information and some important info on how data will be handled. Our firebase account will have free space of 15GB for data. 
-	Google Cloud: the actual storage space where our data is stored. Firebase is just a medium permitting to load and upload data from the cloud. We use a particular @gmail.com account to have access to our 15GB storage in the cloud. Data shall be uploaded from the repository viewed on the app using the View Model or saved locally to the user android mobile phone. And data shall be loaded to the cloud still using the repository but by user having special administration right to affect data in the cloud. 
-	Model (Room): The model is dependent of the repository for the data storage. It is through this that data is being save locally in your android phone after you chose to save it locally on your mobile device. This data being saved is first uploaded by the repository to your phone and then viewed by the user using the view model. The user can later on chose if the data is relevant to be saved locally because on the next cutoff of internet connection, the data shall no more be available and the user will have to load it again. This will save internet consumption.
We shall be using room in this Room DB which is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library. Room will map our database object to Java object and provide an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.  
-	SQLite: To manage our local database, we shall be using SQLite which is a relational database management system.

1.3.	USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
Our user experience design begins at the requirement stage and proceed through all the stages of development including the testing and post-release state. The process for our UX design include research, prototyping, usage ability testing, and finally actual designing part.
The process of UX design involves research, testing and analysis. Hence we shall go through the process of our UI design using the following process: Research, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test and Repeat. 
a.	Research
Through our Google form questionnaire, we received enough information on what should be build and how it should be build. From this we have sufficient information concerning our user desire as far as UX design is concerned. 
Also, we got some of our special user to give us some story of how they will like the app to be to the best of their advantages helping them in solving the difficulties they face throughout their HND program. This user story is very important and vital for our UX design

b.	Define
From our research, we came to a conclusion that our HND android mobile application shall be aimed providing past questions and solutions to our  user and also a means for them to communicate share ideas regarding this questions and solutions. We later on plan on providing a simplified mode of payment through which any HND student can pay his HND exam fee.

c.	Ideate
Here, the ideas of the developers on how the UX should be is clearly made. We design that our app home page shall be a navigation drawer. We shall have a login, sign in and setup screen that will help use have sufficient information on the user and know which data we shall portray to them.
Our home page shall have a home fragment that displays information which the app sees suitable for the user, a chat view that permit them to shat on different questions and solutions and share ideas, a Myfiles fragment that permit us to see files downloaded from the home page or search fragment, a search fragment that permit us to search for specific data on the cloud (though not all data can be accessible by a user), an upload fragment where we can see data that we uploaded from the app the cloud (this data is loaded from the cloud so that if the user want to download and old lost data, he or she can do so, but if the data is still in the phone, then the data can be found the myfiles fragment) and at last there is the setting activity. 
	The navigation drawer also contains share, and exit buttons. From this, we can understand that the navigation drawer provides the swift navigation through the app and hence provide the best and simple UX for our user based on the functionalities on the app.

d.	Prototype
Here we display some of the views of the app and how the user can easily navigate through the respective views. Link to prototype on figma.com here
 
 
Our user experience design can be summarised on this table below
Phase	Discovery	Roles	Deliverables
Discovery	The customer mad his high level requirement which was made the prior goal of team to achieve in the development of the HND android mobile application.	Customers, UX designers, project coordinators.	We deliver a document on how we go about all this procedure.

implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage:19.1.0'

b.	Type of Data Binding
The type of data binding we use was decided from our software architecture documentation where we decided to use the MVVM architect. We bind data both from singletons and providers as shown below.
bind() from singleton { AppDatabase(instance()) }
bind() from singleton { PreferenceProvider(instance()) }
bind() from singleton { UserRepository(instance(), instance()) }
bind() from provider { AuthViewModelFactory(instance()) }

c.	Sign In
Firebase sign in with email and password
String email = userEmail.getText().toString();
String password = userPassword.getText().toString();

if(TextUtils.isEmpty(email)){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Enter email, Email Address field is empty", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
else if(TextUtils.isEmpty(password)){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Enter password, Password field is empty", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
else if(password.length()<6){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Password length should be greater than 5", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
else {
    loadingbar = new ProgressDialog(this);
    loadingbar.setTitle("Login to User Account");
    loadingbar.setMessage("Please wait while we log-in into your account");
    loadingbar.show();
    loadingbar.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true);

    mAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
            if(task.isSuccessful()){
                sendUserToMainActivity();
                Toast.makeText(LoginActivity.this, "You are logged in successfully", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                loadingbar.dismiss();
            }else{
                String errorMessage = task.getException().getMessage();
                Toast.makeText(LoginActivity.this, "Error Message \n" + errorMessage, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                loadingbar.dismiss();
            }
        }
    });
}

d.	Sign Up Code and Authenticate Code
In the setup activity, the user creates an account with email, password and password confirmation. Hence, this is a view of the code to be developed
String email = registerUserEmail.getText().toString();
String password = registerUserPassword.getText().toString();
String confirmPassword = registerUserConfirmPassword.getText().toString();

if(TextUtils.isEmpty(email)){
    Toast.makeText(this, "enter email, Email Address field is empty", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
else if(TextUtils.isEmpty(email)){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Password fiels is empty", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
else if(TextUtils.isEmpty(email)){
    Toast.makeText(this,"Confirm Password field is empty", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
else if(password.length()<6){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Password length should be greater than 5", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
else if(!confirmPassword.equals(password)){
    Toast.makeText(this, "Password does not match Confirm Password", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
else{
    loadingbar = new ProgressDialog(this);
    loadingbar.setTitle("Creating User Account");
    loadingbar.setMessage("Please wait while we are creating your new account");
    loadingbar.show();
    loadingbar.setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true);

    mAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
        @Override
        public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
            if(task.isSuccessful()){
                sendUserToSetupActivity();

                Toast.makeText(RegisterActivity.this,"You have being authenticated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                loadingbar.dismiss();
            }
            else{
                String message = task.getException().getMessage();
                Toast.makeText(RegisterActivity.this, "Error occured \n"+message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                loadingbar.dismiss();
            }
        }
    });
}

e.	Design Pattern (MVVM)
The design pattern we follow in the development of our code is generated from our software architecture and hence we follow the following pattern.
-	First we have the Auth folder where we write code concerning the different means of authentication through Firebase that is authenticate through firebase email and password or using Google Sign in client. The auth also permits us to sign up and setup user profile. In the auth folder, we have three classes, the Firebase class, AuthViewModel, AuthListener.
-	Also, we have the UI folder where the fragment for each view of the navigation drawer is kept. Here we have the code that concerns or related to the UI. We also have the activities which are more UI related and contains logic related to the UI.
-	We have the Data folder that contains three additional folders. One is the Firebase folder that contain all the logic concern the sending and receiving of data from the Google cloud. The DB (database) folder contain the logic that manages related to the app that is being stored locally in the phone local memory. For the database, we shall be using Room Database. We finally have the Repository folder that contains classes which contains logic responsible for making the link and managing the classes in the DB and Firebase folder.
-	At last, we have the Util folder responsible for handle the basic utilities in the app. Those classes and folders not having a specific relationship with the other classes in the different folders but have logic that has functional and essential use in the app are placed in the Util folder. An example is a “post module” aimed at setting the getter and setter functions for data that will be needed in the post activity.
-	public PostModule(String uid, String time, String date, String description, String fullName, String postImage, String profileImage) {
    this.uid = uid;
    this.time = time;
    this.date = date;
    this.description = description;
    this.fullName = fullName;
    this.postImage = postImage; }

public void setUid(String uid) {
    this.uid = uid;
}
public String getUid() {
    return uid;
}
public void setTime(String time) {
    this.time = time;
}
public String getTime() {
    return time;
}
public void setDate(String date) {
    this.date = date;
}
public String getDate() {
    return date;
}
public void setDescription(String description) {
    this.description = description;
}
public String getDescription() {
    return description;
}
public void setFullName(String fullName) {
    this.fullName = fullName;
}
-	
public String getFullName() {
    return fullName;
}
-	
public void setPostImage(String postImage) {
    this.postImage = postImage;
}
-	
public String getPostImage() {
    return postImage;
}
